# NEMOLite2D Benchmark(s) #

Below this directory are various versions of the NEMOLite2D benchmark.
Those that have been converted into PSyKAl form all use the kernels
contained within the `kernels` directory. Various routines that are
common to most of the NEMOLite2D benchmarks (such as those that do I/O)
are in the `common` directory and are compiled into an archive.

## original ##

The `original` directory contains the initial, serial, single source-file
version of NEMOLite2D.

## manual_versions ##

This directory contains various manual implementations (i.e. the PSy layer
is written manually rather than generated by PSyclone) of NEMOLite2D.
These were developed in order to inform PSyclone development.

## psykal ##

This directory contains the version of NEMOLite2D that uses PSyclone to
generate the PSy layer. The same source is then used to generate serial and
OpenMP versions through the use of different transformation scripts.
