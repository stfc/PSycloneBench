# Implementation of Shallow for Maxeler System #

This directory contains an un-finished port of Shallow to the Maxeler
environment. It is intended to be developed within the MaxIDE (Maxeler
extension of Eclipse). The driver code (in the CPUCode directory) is
written in C and the kernels (below the EngineCode directory) are 
written in MaxJ.
