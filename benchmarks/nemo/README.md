# NEMO-based benchmarks #

This directory contains various benchmarks that have been extracted
from the NEMO ocean model (www.nemo-ocean.eu).

## NEMOLite2D ##

Originally created by Hedong Liu of the National Oceanographic Centre,
Liverpool. This is based on the 2D, free-surface component of NEMO and
includes both hard (land) and tidally-forced boundary conditions.

## tracer_advection ##

This is based on one of the tracer-advection routines from the NEMO
code base, restructured slightly so as to be a standalone program.
It was originally produced by Silvia Mocavero of the 
Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC).
