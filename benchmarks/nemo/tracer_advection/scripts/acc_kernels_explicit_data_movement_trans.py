'''A transformation script that seeks to apply OpenACC KERNELS directives to
NEMO style code. In order to use it you must first install PSyclone. See
README.md in the top-level directory.

Once you have psyclone installed, this may be used by doing:

 $ psyclone -api nemo -s <this_script> <target_source_file>

The transformation script attempts to insert Kernels directives at the
highest possible location(s) in the schedule tree (i.e. to enclose as
much code as possible in each Kernels region).

    OpenACC 'kernels' and 'data movement' directives to NEMO code.

    :param psy: The PSy layer object to apply transformations to.
